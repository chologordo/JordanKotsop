          <h2>Summary of Myself</h2>
          <p>At age 26 I find myself living in Dubai three years after courageously deciding to leave the Canadian finance industry from which I had a stable, lucrative career lined up. I have lived, learned and worked in four culturally different countries (Canada, United States, Spain and UAE), all the while traveling and experiencing many more. If I was to define my personal “super power” I would define it as having the unique ability to foresee the opportunity of collaboration between two or more ideas, businesses or people and identifying how they can gain mutual benefits (opportunity optimizer). I’m an active, rapid learning with intense curiosity, always reading new books or pursing free online courses and masterclasses relating to coding, music, business or progressive learning and personal wellbeing.</p>

            <p>UCAM was a transcendent experience for me as it was the foundation of my leap from the finance industry into the world of sports.  I left Canada on a whim to attend the magestic, Hogwarts-like school of UCAM to begin my voyage of folloing my passion. The journey in Murcia, Spain took me down a path learning from some of the top professionals in the sports industry World Wide, such as the marketing team that developes Championsleague logos and activation plans, the infamous sports Lawyer Juan Dios Crespo who has represented both Barcelona and Real Madrid in legal cases, and many more. After finishing my studies and learning the Spanish language at UCAM, I realized the path for me was leading outside of Spain, further east from Canada into the middle east...</p>

            <p>I attended Wilfrid Laurier after completeing a year and a half in the United States following the NCAA scholarship route.  My transfer to Lauier wasn't a smooth one, but it proved to be the right path. I graduated with a degree in Applied Economics and many life long friends, I believe it was my experience at Laurier and the relationships I made there that pushed me to seeing my chosen path in the Sports Industry.</p>
